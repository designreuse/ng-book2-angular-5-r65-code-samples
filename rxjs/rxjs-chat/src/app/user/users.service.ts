// Briefly, two benefits of dependency - injection are:
// 1 we let Angular handle the lifecycle of the object and
// 2 itâ€™s easier to test injected components.


// BehaviourSubject84 has a special property in that it stores the last value.Meaning that any
// subscriber to the stream will receive the latest value.This is great for us because it means that any
// part of our application can subscribe to the UsersService.currentUser stream and immediately
// know who the current user is.
